        <h1>Proverbs 10:1</h1>

        <blockquote>
            A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>Who is the Wise?</b><br>
        A wise son <b>listens</b> and <b>makes good choices</b>. His actions bring <b>delight</b> and <b>happiness</b> to those who care for him.</p>

        <p><b>And Who is the Foolish?</b><br>
        A foolish son <b>ignores advice</b> and <b>acts carelessly</b>. His actions cause <b>worry</b> and <b>disappointment</b> for those who love him.</p>

        <p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
        A wise person shows <b>good respect</b> and <b>responsibility</b>, which makes others feel <b>secure</b> and <b>encouraged</b> because of his wisdom in handling daily matters. However, a fool shows little regard for <b>guidance</b> and <b>responsibility</b>, which makes others feel <b>anxious</b> and <b>burdened</b> because of the trouble his choices create.</p>
