        <h1>Proverbs 10:1</h1>

        <blockquote>
            A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>Who is the Wise?</b><br>
        A wise son listens and makes good choices. His actions bring delight and happiness to those who care for him.</p>

        <p><b>And Who is the Foolish?</b><br>
        A foolish son ignores advice and acts carelessly. His actions cause worry and disappointment for those who love him.</p>

        <p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
        A wise person shows good respect and responsibility, which makes others feel secure and encouraged because of his wisdom in handling daily matters. However, a fool shows little regard for guidance and responsibility, which makes others feel anxious and burdened because of the trouble his choices create.</p>
